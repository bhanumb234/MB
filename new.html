          <span>Hey Gigglemug,</span>
          <br />
          This name suits your smile. Through this I've drawn to you.<br />
          I am doing this for the first time for anyone. Okay So we first met at <br />
          Rotkar's birthday party. After that we again met in iGate <br />
          From there I started crushing on you. I haven't told you about <br />
          this earlier but I really like you. I wanted to tell you this <br />
          in a different way. I am not much good at expressing these but I am trying to <br />
          do my best. 
          <br />
